# Wordle-Game
This project was a key learning experience that helped me become familiar with C++, web development with the Wt framework, and RESTful API integration. I also learned how to host the application on a our schools Linux compute server. Overall, the development of this website using C++ has provided me with valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the language.
